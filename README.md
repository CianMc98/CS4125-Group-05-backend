When Maven Build Scripts appears on IntelliJ, click "Load Maven Project", once this is done you will be able to run the backend of the code.

You will need XAMPP Control Panel before running the backend. When XAMPP opens, you need to click "Start" beside MySQL. After this is done you can run the backend of the code. You will need to create a new schema on MySQL workbench called cs4125-group51 for our project to run.
